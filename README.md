# HR-Analysis
## Project overview

this perform a comprehensive analysis of employee demographics and compensation data to uncover patterns and insights related to gender distribution, salary trends, educational influence, age demographics, tenure, and pay equity within the organization.

## Data sources
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the GlobalTech HR Employee Dataset (2025 Edition), an internal dataset collected and maintained by the Human Resources department of GlobalTech Solutions. It includes anonymized employee records and is used to support strategic HR decision-making and workforce analytics

## TOOLS

Excel-data cleaning, pivot table etc

Excel- Data visualization

## Data cleaning/Preparation


-Standardization: Categorical values (e.g., Job Titles, Education Levels, Gender) we standardized for consistency.


- Data Types: Date fields were converted to proper date format; salary and age fields were validated as numeric.


-The final dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

## Exploratory data analysis

.What is the percentage distribution of genders across different job 
titles?
 
 . What is the average salary for employees with different education 
qualifications?

 . What is the age distribution for employees in different job titles?

 . What is the average tenure (calculated using Date of Job) for employees in 
different age groups?

 . What is the salary range for each job title, and are there any outliers?

 ## Key insights/findings

 ### Gender Distribution Insights by Job Title

From the analysis, we observed notable gender imbalances in specific job roles:

    
 - Marketing Manager roles are more male-dominated, with 8.22% male representation compared to 4.55% female.

  -Research Analyst positions also show higher male participation at 12.33%, versus 7.95% female.

  -In contrast, Research Scientist roles are predominantly held by females, with 12.50% female and only 5.48% male.

-These findings suggest that certain roles attract or retain specific genders more than others, highlighting potential areas for diversity and inclusion efforts.



### This analysis revealed a clear trend: employees with higher educational qualifications tend to earn higher salaries. For example, individuals with Master’s  degrees consistently received higher average compensation compared to those with only Diploma School education. This suggests a positive correlation between education level and earning potential within the organization.


### Age Distribution and Job Role Insight

The analysis showed a balanced age distribution across most job titles, indicating a healthy mix of both younger and older employees. However, roles like Marketing Specialist and Marketing Manager had fewer employees compared to more populated positions such as Packaging Associate, suggesting potential differences in hiring volume or workforce demand across roles
Average Tenure by Age Group

### This analysis also indicates that employees aged 25 to 34 tend to have longer average tenure within the organization, suggesting greater stability and retention. In contrast, employees aged 20 to 24 show shorter tenure, indicating higher turnover or shorter-term employment in this age group.




### Salary Range by Job Title

Our analysis of salary ranges by job title revealed that Project Managers tend to receive the highest compensation compared to other roles within the organization. This reflects the higher level of responsibility and experience typically associated with this position.

## Recommendation

###  Based on our findings,the following actions are recommended:
   
 - Address Gender Imbalance in Key Roles
    The gender disparities in roles such as Marketing Manager (male-dominated) and Research Scientist (female-dominated) suggest the need for focused diversity initiatives. Implement targeted recruitment efforts, mentorship programs, and inclusive workplace policies to foster balanced gender representation across all job titles.

 - Enhance Educational Opportunities to Boost Compensation and Growth
    Since higher education levels correlate strongly with higher salaries, invest in employee development through tuition assistance, professional certifications, and continuous learning programs. This will not only improve individual earning potential but also strengthen organizational expertise and retention.

-  Strategically Review Workforce Allocation in Understaffed Roles
    Job titles like Marketing Specialist and Marketing Manager have comparatively fewer employees, which may indicate gaps in workforce planning. Conduct a detailed staffing analysis and consider recruitment drives or internal transfers to optimize workforce distribution and meet operational demands.

 - Improve Retention Among Younger Employees
    Employees aged 20–24 demonstrate shorter tenures compared to older cohorts. Develop tailored onboarding, career pathing, and engagement programs that address the unique needs and expectations of younger employees, thereby improving retention and reducing turnover costs.

 - Recognize and Support High-Value Roles Through Leadership Development
    With Project Managers receiving the highest salaries, it’s clear these roles carry significant responsibility and impact. Provide ongoing leadership training, clear advancement paths, and performance incentives to retain top talent and maximize organizational outcomes.
